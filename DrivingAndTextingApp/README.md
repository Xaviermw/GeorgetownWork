Explanation of the Software:

Texting and Driving is a serious affliction that plagues our society today, especially more so than ever now that technological
distractions are on the rise, and a new generation of motorists is being raised while surrounded by an exploding market of cell phones 
and hand-held devices. 'No Need for Speed' is an Applet that demonstrates to the user the dangers of multitasking while behind the wheel of a vehicle.
The User must navigate his or her car through a highway populated with cars traveling at a slightly slower speed than the User.
The User is presented with a notification when a text message is ready to be typed and sent on its way. A timer gives the User
an incentive to sent the message as quickly as possible, while simultaneously avoiding collisions with other vehicles. The longer
the user lasts, the higher the 'score'.

The goal of our Software is not to condition the user to get better at texting and driving. It is doubtful that the User will 
achieve significant results in terms of mentally conditioning themselves to text and drive. Instead, we sought out the goal of
raising awareness of the impossibility of successfully balancing two actions that require attention and focus for extending
periods of time. We hope that the User will make the executive decision to abstain from texting and driving as a result from:
playing the game and losing, thus seeing the intrinsic difficulty of multitasking, and from the educational facts we have included
to better society's understanding of the dangers of texting and driving. Thus we have utilized both ethos and logos, the bodily harm
that comes from vehicular collisions, and the fines that consequently come from being caught by law enforcement.

The game is seemingly simply, yet the users typically found it challenging after several attempts. User surveys revealed that the game
had taught each user something substantial, whether it was a fact about driving restrictions/fines, or a demonstration of why texting and
driving is dangerous, and not a game.
